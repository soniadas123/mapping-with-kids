# Mapping with Kids

A small GIS course for kids, built around [GeoLibre](https://geolibre.app), a
free and open-source web GIS tool.

**Live site:** https://soniadas123.github.io/mapping-with-kids/

## What's here

- `index.html` — the cover page, linking to the PDFs below.
- `Remote_Sensing_and_GIS_Intro.pdf` — a short intro to remote sensing,
  satellites, and GIS, meant to be read before Exercise 1.
- `exercise1/` — Exercise 1: building a map of India.
  - `Map_of_India_Tutorial.pdf` — the step-by-step tutorial.
  - `data/` — the GeoJSON boundary data used in the exercise (the large
    `.geojson` files are not tracked in this repo; see below).
  - `screenshot/` — reference screenshots from the exercise.
- `exercise2/` — Exercise 2: putting famous places of India on the map.
  - `Famous_Places_Tutorial.pdf` — the step-by-step tutorial.
  - `Famous_Places_Tutorial.html` — the source for the PDF. Edit this,
    then rebuild the PDF from the `exercise2/` folder with Edge:
    `msedge --headless --print-to-pdf=Famous_Places_Tutorial.pdf Famous_Places_Tutorial.html`
  - `screenshot/s2.png` — example image used on the cover. The steps have
    no screenshots on purpose, so students build their own map.
  - `data/famous_places.csv` — 16 landmarks with latitude and longitude.
    The India outline is reused from Exercise 1.
- `exercise3/` — Exercise 3: drawing distance zones (buffers) around your city.
  - `Near_or_Far_Tutorial.pdf` — the step-by-step tutorial.
  - `Near_or_Far_Tutorial.html` — the source for the PDF. Rebuild it from the
    `exercise3/` folder with Edge:
    `msedge --headless --print-to-pdf=Near_or_Far_Tutorial.pdf Near_or_Far_Tutorial.html`
  - `data/my_city.csv` — a one-row starting point (Bangalore) that students
    change to their own city. Reuses the Exercise 1 and 2 data.
- `exercise4/` — Exercise 4: exploring the Himalayas with 3D terrain.
  - `Himalayas_3D_Tutorial.pdf` — the step-by-step tutorial.
  - `Himalayas_3D_Tutorial.html` — the source for the PDF. Rebuild it from the
    `exercise4/` folder with Edge:
    `msedge --headless --print-to-pdf=Himalayas_3D_Tutorial.pdf Himalayas_3D_Tutorial.html`
  - No new data: GeoLibre loads elevation tiles itself, and the India outline
    is reused from Exercise 1.

## Note on large files

A few large working files are intentionally excluded from this repo (see
`.gitignore`) since they aren't needed to view the tutorials:
`exercise1/screenshot/exercise1.html`, `exercise1/screenshot/exercise1.geolibre.json`,
and the raw `.geojson` boundary data in `exercise1/data/`. Those stay on the
original working machine.
